# Problem - Palindromic Numbers
![Palindrome](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT5LMYqyIPJtjnjiHm/giphy.gif)

The number 47 has an interesting characteristic.

If you take the number, plus its reverse (47 => 74) and then add them together to a number (47+74=121) the resulting sum is a palindrome

Starting at 0, find the first 25 numbers that have this same characteristic as 47, but limit it to where the palindrome is greater than 1000.

Collect the results in an array. Be sure that you're collecting the interesting numbers like 47, not the palindromic sums.

Bonus points if you can do this without converting numbers to strings/arrays.
